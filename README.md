# Deep-Learning-using-Tensorflow-and-Keras-in-R

Hi this is my repositories for deep learning method using Tensorflow and Keras coded with R language programming in R-Studio, broken into several modules:

Module 1: A deep learning algorithm to predict MNIST (image data). I also compiled the reimplementation of Tensorflow from scratch using low level codes (without using Keras functionality) to reveal the details of what is happening behind the process of deep learning.

Module 2: A deep learning algorithm to classify positive and negative reviews (A binary classification) using textual data from IMDB dataset.

Module 3: A multi-classification algorithm using deep learning to classify short newswires and their topics published by Reuters. 

Module 4: A regression problem using deep learning to predict house prices.
